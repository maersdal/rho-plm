# rhoplm

FIXME: Write a one-line description of your library/project.

## Overview

FIXME: Write a paragraph about the library/project and highlight its goals.

rho-plm stem:[\rho\text{-plm}]

project parts:

* frontend with searchable features
* devices (services?) as graphs
* history
* integration with files/notes/images/data

### Comparison with traditional tools

I think everything stored in a central location is an outdated meme, welcome to the distributed world m8
Single source of truth immediately requires locking of files... Git got around this, it is workable

Want to integrate:
product development (plms only do this really...)
product lifecycle  
product analysis

compatible with a modern IT infrastructure, that is, everybody using different tools for everything.
All we need is an API...


### Stories

If a certain configuration has an associated HIGHER failure rate, we would like to see it.
the failure rate is calculated by some processing, and the configuration is the unique subtree of a service

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    clojure -A:fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    rm -rf target/public

To create a production build run:

	rm -rf target/public
	clojure -A:fig:min

created with 
clojure -Tclj-new create :template figwheel-main :name eplme/rhoplm :args '["+npm-bundle","--reagent"]'
