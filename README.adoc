# rhoplm

stem:[\rho\text{-plm}]

## Overview

rho-plm is intended to be an experiment to see what the minimal shim is for a product lifecycle management tool.
On the top, there is the database, chosen to be xtdb, could maybe become something else in the future.
At the bottom is lots of process information.
The shim in the middle is this repository.

project parts:

* frontend with searchable features
* devices (services?) as graphs
* history
* integration with files/notes/images/data

### Comparison with traditional tools

I think everything stored in a central location is an outdated meme, welcome to the distributed world m8
Single source of truth immediately requires locking of files... Git got around this, it is workable

Want to integrate:
product development (plms only do this really...)
product lifecycle  
product analysis

compatible with a modern IT infrastructure, that is, everybody using different tools for everything.
All we need is an API...

## Data model

Everything is a graph, which evolves over time. 
A product type with its different options is a graph 
Firmware(code) for the product is a graph




### Stories

#### a product
If a certain configuration has an associated HIGHER failure rate, we would like to see it.
the failure rate is calculated by some processing, and the configuration is the unique subtree of a service

#### dev cycle
"To track velocity, focus on functionality completed (not functionality worked on), focus on functionality delivered (not functionality requested or promised), focus on functionality used (not estimates of business value), track defects (and time spent on defects), track technical debt (not just having it and repaying it, but the consequences of having it) and so on. As in physics, velocity in software development is multidimensional." - Kevlin Henney  

Is this a graph, or easily done with jira?


## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

 npx shadow-cljs watch frontend

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    rm -rf target/public

To create a production build run:

	rm -rf target/public
	clojure -A:fig:min

created with 
clojure -Tclj-new create :template figwheel-main :name eplme/rhoplm :args '["+npm-bundle","--reagent"]'
