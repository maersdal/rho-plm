## Design

.Main ideas
* Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Fleet Management, and similar processes have a common, high-level data structure
** At any *_time_*, the state of a project is one or more graphs, where each node is a work-product related to the parent node.
*** For example, the subassemblies of a project is one graph, while the firmware is another graph, and we can link these two graphs at the root node to make it a single graph.
** A delivered product starts as a strict subgraph of the project, taken at a specific *_time_*.
*** A delivered products graph can also evolve in time, for example change of service location, firmware updates, repairs, etc.
* A system that lets you see the pieces of your projects does not need to store those pieces, they can be stored anywhere
** A rejection of the 'all in one' big single database idea from other systems. The idea is from the age of mainframes, and is a serialized in processes that could be parallel.
* Having a graph that links between all your orgs information is much, much better and can create better synergy than any vendor-specific tool.

A designed item or work-product has pieces that fit together; seeing them all, and making them queriable is great.

.The domain is defined as such:
. The node represents an item. It could be
.. A component
.. A unit
.. A subassembly
.. A firmware version
. The item has resources somewhere, and the node contains or links to these. The resources could be
.. A subgraph of other nodes in the system
.. The requirements
.. Drawings, Images
.. Link to a grafana dashboard showing time-series data for the thing
. The vertices represents the trees of structure. It could be:
.. The components available at certain times
.. A particular manufacturing configuration
.. The firmware tree

The node is the basic unit, and it changes over time. The changes are all recorded in the database, so 
a thing referring to a node might choose to use the valid time of that node..


### MVP 

* Smallest possible demo that shows that the bitemporal graph approach is useful
* A UI where you can click onto each part of the firmware and electronics. 
* state representations:
** time, configuration 
* typical questions:
** where has unit 77 been with what firmwares ?
** what firmwares are deployed ?
** what electronics configurations are on which units ?


Data entry comes later


## Tech stack

The tech stack has the goals of enabling a single developer to deliver powerful features in a reasonable amount of time
and at the same time have good structure.

.Tech stack
* `deps.edn` dependency management.
* Frontend:
** `ClojureScript`
** `shadow-cljs` for cljs development.
** `re-frame` and `reagent` as the UI framework. 
* Backend:
** web services:
*** `ring` and `reitit` for routing
*** Thinking of adding `pathom` for service resolution
** databases and logic
*** `xtdb` for a bitemporal graph database
*** `engelberg/ubergraph` for graph manipulation and display
**** needs `graphViz`
* observability:
** `mulog` for logging
** `tufte` for profiling

### Ideas
 
* Search, elaborate


## Learning points 

The nodes have to **point** somewhere, if not they are just org tools.

where do they point? To the resource described. IF it's firmware; the git pull request
If it is work in progress? maybe these:
 * Google drive document 
 * Jira 
 * Confluence 
 * Miro
